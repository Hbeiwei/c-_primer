allocator Library class that allocates  memory.
dangling pointer A pointer that refers to
memory that once had an object but no
longer does. Program errors due to  pointers are notoriously difficult to
debug.
delete Frees memory allocated by new.
delete p frees the object and delete [] p
frees the array to which p points. p may be
null or point to memory allocated by new.
deleter Function passed to a smart pointer
to use in place of delete when destroying
the object to which the pointer is bound.
destructor Special member function that
cleans up an object when the object goes out
of scope or is deleted.
dynamically allocated Object that is  on the free store. Objects allocated on
the free store exist until they are explicitly
deleted or the program terminates.
free store Memory pool available to a  to hold dynamically allocated objects.
heap Synonym for free store.
new Allocates memory from the free store.
new T allocates and constructs an object of
type T and returns a pointer to that object;
if T is an array type, new returns a pointer
to the first elements in the array. Similarly
